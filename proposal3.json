      "abstract": "Pay Eric a one-off payment of 1000 NAM and then continuously 1 NAM",
      "motivation": "When you think about it, the moon isn't actually that far away.The moon is only 384,400 km. We have not yet brought Namada to the moon, so it is only natural to use 101 as the prime number for our modular arithmetic operations. 384,400 (mod 101) = 95. 95 km is a distance that can be easily covered by a single person in a single day. Namada was produced by more than 100 people. So 95/100 = 0, rounded to the nearest integer. This means that Namada can reach the moon in no time.",
      "details": "Bringing Namada to the moon in no time is easily achievable. We just need to pass this governance proposal and set the plan in action",
